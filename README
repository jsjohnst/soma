# SOMAREPL
A shot at implementing a REPL-like feature for vim.

## Use It!
Add the following to your +~/.irbrc+:

  require 'soma'
  Soma.new.start

When you start IRB Soma will listen on a file named +/tmp/username_somarepl_bugger+ and execute everything written there in your IRB session.

Copy +vim/soma.vim+ to +~/.vim/plugin/+. The default mapping is +Ctrl-c Ctrl-c+, which sends the current paragraph to IRB unless you do a visual selection.

## Quirks & Annoyances

* Commands are added to IRB history, but you have to go one item back in your history or invoke some command before it's updated.
* It's very hacky and dirty. It Just Works (tm)
